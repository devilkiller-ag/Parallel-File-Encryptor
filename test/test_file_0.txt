I am an engineering physics undergraduate passionate about Quantum Computing and Web Development. 
About two years ago, when I first discovered the field of Web Development and Quantum Computing, 
it totally amazed me and I have been dedicating my education to them ever since. Over the past two years, 
I have dedicated a considerable amount of time and effort to learning and developing skills in these fields 
by taking various online courses, reading different articles, making several projects, and involving in various 
research internships and mentorship programs. Fast forward to today, I am currently working as a Quantum Computing 
Intern at Creed & Bear and open-source contributor at the AsyncAPI Initiative.
